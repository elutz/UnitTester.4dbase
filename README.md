UnitTester for 4D v18R6 and later
=============================

Work is based on Mark Schaake's UnitTester component [UnitTester for 4D v11 and v12](https://github.com/markschaake/UnitTester4D).

Main difference is, tha all added test suites and test cases are stored in JSON format instead of the previous binary format, so they can be added to a version control system like Git.

An old and a bit outdated Documentation can be found [here (PDF)](Resources/UnitTester_Reference.pdf). It is based on the original component.

But it is good for a start.
